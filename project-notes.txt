This app an account list manager app. Users can add accounts, list the added accounts, and filter them.

First, I created an Angular project. Then, I created a layout. Afterward,
I implemented the DevExpress data-grid table into the project and converted this table into the UI in the design.

Next, I finished the UI part of the filtering area and the button for adding a new account.

Then, I started working on the modal. First, I created a baseModal. Using this baseModal,
I built a structure that allows me to create different modals as I wish. Afterward, I created the modal in the design.

Then, it was time to deal with the data.
I set up a store mechanism using Signal. I was able to deliver the data to all components through a single file.
